Data Sources:

crime rate per year (2010-2014) - https://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/State/StatebyState.cfm

Household Income per year (2010-2014) - https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:eVDTvmR6SkUJ:https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/tables/time-series/historical-income-households/h08.xls+&cd=14&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us


I found two excel datasets on two different websites comparing different crime rates per state vs. household income per state. We are 
trying to see in there is any correlation between crime rates ans household incomes, mainly if poor states account for higher crime rates 
and vice versa.

Using Python, Flask, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS; I'll be creating multiple visualizations such as bar graph, line graph and interactive 
visualization.

For the bar chart I will simply be comparing the crime and household income by a specific year or multiple years(deciding on that)

For the line chart I will be comparing the same but will have multiple dropdowns to which the user can switch between years.

For the interactivate visual, I will show a bubble chart(or something else) that can combine both crime and household income as well as 
split them too(still deciding on that as well).


Data Processess:
- Filter Datasets and rename colunms
- Drop unwanted colunms and clean it
- clean by dropping duplicate colunms
- sort each columns to the correct decades 

Database:
SQLite
